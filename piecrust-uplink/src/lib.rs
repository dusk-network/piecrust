//! Piecrust Uplink is the crate for writing WASM smart contracts in Rust
//! targeting the Piecrust virtual machine.
//!
//! A smart contract is a program exposing a collection of functions that
//! operate on a shared state. These functions can perform a variety of
//! operations, such as reading or modifying the state, or interacting with the
//! host.
//!
//! # State Model and ABI
//! Contracts targeting the Piecrust VM represent their state as a [WASM
//! memory]. The contract is free to represent its data as it sees fit, and may
//! allocate at will.
//!
//! To communicate with the host, both the contract and the host can
//! emplace data in a special region of this memory called the argument buffer.
//! The argument buffer is used as both the input from the host and as the
//! output of the contract. All functions exposed by the contract must follow
//! the convention:
//!
//! ```c
//! // A function compatible with the piecrust ABI takes in the number of bytes
//! // written by the host to the argument buffer and returns the number of
//! // bytes written by the contract.
//! uint32_t fname(uint32_t arg_len);
//! ```
//!
//! The contract also has some functions available to it, offered by the host
//! through WASM imports. Examples of these functions include, but are not
//! limited to:
//!
//! - [`call`] to call another contract
//! - [`emit`] to emit events
//!
//! The functions in this crate are wrappers around a particular way of calling
//! the WASM imports. Take a look at the [externs] for a full view of what is
//! available.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Some of the contracts used for testing purposes function as good examples.
//! Take a look at the [contracts/] directory.
//!
//! # Features
//! By default, this crate will include no features and build only the types and
//! functions available when the ABI is not present. To write a contract one
//! must use the `abi` feature:
//!
//! - `abi` for writing contracts
//! - `dlmalloc` to using the builtin allocator
//! - `debug` for writing contracts with debug capabilities such as the
//!   [`debug!`] macro, and logging panics to stdout
//!
