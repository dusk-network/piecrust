Crumbles is a Rust library designed for creating and managing copy-on-write memory-mapped regions. This allows for efficient memory handling by tracking changes at page level. It's particularly suitable for scenarios where memory snapshots and reverting to previous states are required.

## Usage

The core fuctionality of Crumbles is provided by the `Mmap` struct. This struct offers methods to manage memory regions, create snapshots and revert/apply changes.

Add `crumbles` as a dependency to your contract project:
```sh
cargo add crumbles
```

To make use of `crumbles`, import the dependency in your project. Example:
```rust
use crumbles::Mmap;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut mmap = Mmap::new(65536, 65536)?;

    // When first created, the mmap is not dirty.
    assert_eq!(mmap.dirty_pages().count(), 0);

    mmap[24] = 42;

    // After writing a single byte, the page it's on is dirty.
    assert_eq!(mmap.dirty_pages().count(), 1);

    Ok(())
}

```
